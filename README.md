MberLinuxSDK
============

Quick and dirty conversion of Windows SDK to Linux.

Sorry for the mess. All the Poco libs are copied here for convenience. You probably want to work based off the the ```arch/linux_64``` branch.
The actual Mber code is in ```generated``` and ```src```. The rest is due for cleanup. 

**Note: Use the Poco 1.5.3 libraries. Those are the latest and they're not backward-compatible.***
